## Flowers
**Flowers** is a constantly evolving, nethack-like RPG. It is created for fun an profit (in form of learning new stuff and having a great time) for us and you. Currently there are the following features included:

* A player character with strength, dexterity and intelligence - just like you!
* Horrible Orcs and Dark Elves as enemies - just like in the real world!
* A system for awesome items - completely ready (read: rudimentary)!
* A system for epic battles - in an arena (again, rudimentary)!
* An automatically generated world - full of beauty!
